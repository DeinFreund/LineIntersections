# LineIntersections

line.cpp takes line segments and tells you whether they intersect. Line segments can have zero length.

Input:
N: Number of test cases
Followed by 8N integers describing the starting and end points of both lines in each test case.

Output:
NO, SEGMENT or POINT describing the way the two lines intersect

There's a small and a big test case for checking correctness.
